<h1>Firs: a Framework for Information Retrieval Systems.</h1>

Firs have multiple functions:
<ul>
  <li> It allows to import and evalutate traditional TREC collections </li>
  <li> It allows to compute an experimental Grid of Points (GoP) </li>
  <li> It allows to compute and handle replicates (such as shards or reformulations) </li>
</ul>


<h2>Install</h2>

To install firs, use the pip command:

<code>pip install firs</code>


<h2>The configuration file</h2>

To work, firs relies on a configuration file. The configuration file needs a section for the paths and a section for each of the collections that you want to work on. In the "path" section, it is mandatory to specify the path to the jdk. Notice that, firs is based on pyterrier and therefore requires a jdk â‰¥ 11
