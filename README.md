<h1>firs: a (python) Framework for Information Retrieval Systems.</h1>

Firs is a python package, based on pyterrier, developed to help experimentation in Information Retireval.

Firs have multiple functions:
<ul>
  <li> It allows to import and evalutate traditional TREC collections </li>
  <li> It allows to compute an experimental Grid of Points (GoP) </li>
  <li> It allows to compute and handle replicates (such as shards or reformulations) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting firs up</h2>

<h3>Install</h3>

To install firs, use the pip command:

<code>pip install firs</code>


<h3>The configuration file</h3>

To work, firs relies on a configuration file. The configuration file needs a section for the paths and a section for each of the collections that you want to work on. In the "path" section, it is mandatory to specify the path to the jdk. Notice that, firs is based on pyterrier and therefore requires a jdk â‰¥ 11.


an example of configuration file:
```
[paths]
JAVAHOME = /usr/lib/jdk-11.0.11

[collections.robust04]
runs_path = ./data/TREC/TREC_13_2004_Robust/runs/
qrel_path = ./data/TREC/TREC_13_2004_Robust/pool/qrels.robust2004.txt
coll_path = ./EXPERIMENTAL_COLLECTIONS/TIPSTER/CORPUS
shrd_path = ./data/shardings/

[collections.trec08]
runs_path = ./data/TREC/TREC_08_1999_AdHoc/runs/all/
qrel_path = ./data/TREC/TREC_08_1999_AdHoc/pool/qrels.trec8.adhoc.txt
shrd_path = ./data/shardings/
```

Non-public elements, such as the qrels, are not provided by firs. They need to be placed in the path specified in the configuration file. In any cases, firs can used to build runs and grid of points starting from a collection. 

<h2>Initializing firs</h2>
Once the configuration file is ready, it is possible to start working with firs.

Import firs and configure it:
```
import firs
firs.configure(<path to configuration file>)
```

<h3>firs as Collections Manager</h3>

<h3>Importing a Collection</h3>

To import a trec collection,  run

```
#import the metadata of the collection
collection = firs.TrecCollection(collectionName=<name of the collection>)

#import the collection: the operation might be very time consuming
collection = collection.import_collection()
```

The function ```import_collection``` takes ```nThreads``` as additional parameter to import the runs in a parallel fashon. If you want to import the runs using 10 processors, do:

```
collection = collection.import_collection(nThreads=10)
```


<h3>Computing measures</h3>
To compute the measures on the selected collection, using the given qrels, run:
```
measures = collection.evaluate()
```
Notice that, this command assumes to have the full collection available (qrels alongside runs) and imported.

In some cases, the number of runs might be extremely high and it might be preferable to compute the measure run by run on the fly, avoiding to load all the runs. 
By running

```
measures = collection.parallel_evalutate(nThreads=<number of threads>)
```
It is possible to compute the measure in a parallel fashon and without preloading all the runs. 

Finally, it might be preferable, if available, to directly import a measure file. The path to the measure file need to be specified in the configuration file, under the proper collection, using the label ```msrs_path=path to the csv containing the measures```.
Using the command:

```
measures = collection.import_measures()
```
It is possible to directly import the proper measure file.
Notice that, using either ```parallel_evaluate``` and ```import_measures``` there is no need to run ```import_collection``` on the collection object before.

<h3>Replicates</h3>

Replicates represent multiple istances of the same experiment. An experiment is characterized by a subject (in IR, usually a topic) and the experimental conditions (in IR, usually the system used). Several approaches have been proposed to obtain the replicates. The simplest possible consists in considering human-made query reformulations. Note that, we do not provide any kind of dataset containing replicates: we only provide a strategy to handle them. A second approach consists in using reformulations. 

<h4>Shardings</h4>

The sharding procedure consists in inflating the number of observations by splitting the corpora into multiple subcorpora and running a specific experiment (a system applied to a specific query) multiple times, over each of the subcorpora.

A sharding on a collection is characterized by 3 elements:
<ul>
  <li>The number of shards</li>
  <li>The number of documents in each shard</li>
  <li>Whether shards are allowed or not</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reformulations</h4>
